# sprite-lite

Zero-dependency 8×8 pixel-art animation component for React.

## Quick start

```tsx
// Bare — cycles all 55 variants on click
<ThinkingSprite />

// Fixed variant — no cycling
<ThinkingSprite variant="DNA" />

// Subset cycling — cycles only these three on click/Enter/Space
<ThinkingSprite variants={["EKG", "DNA", "Pulse"]} />

// LED matrix mode — dim background + lit color
<ThinkingSprite variant="DNA" color={["#00ff88", "#1a2a1a"]} size={48} />

// Paused — freezes on current frame
<ThinkingSprite active={false} />

// WriteSprite — spells text letter by letter
<WriteSprite text="HELLO" size={32} />
```

## ThinkingSprite props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `size` | `number` | `16` | Side length in px. SVG scales to any size; viewBox stays 8×8. |
| `variant` | `VariantName` | — | Lock to a single variant. Disables cycling when set. |
| `variants` | `VariantName[]` | — | Subset to cycle through. Ignored when `variant` is set. |
| `active` | `boolean` | `true` | When `false`, animation freezes on the current frame. |
| `color` | `string \| [string, string]` | `currentColor` | Single color for lit pixels, or `[primary, dim]` for LED matrix mode. |
| `speed` | `number` | `90` | Milliseconds per animation tick. Lower = faster. |

## WriteSprite props

Spells out text letter by letter using a built-in 3×5 pixel font. Supports A–Z, 0–9, and ` !?.`.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text` | `string` | `'HELLO'` | Text to animate. Characters not in the font are skipped. |
| `size` | `number` | `16` | Side length in px. |
| `speed` | `number` | `90` | Milliseconds per animation tick. Lower = faster. |
| `active` | `boolean` | `true` | When `false`, animation freezes on the current frame. |
| `color` | `string \| [string, string]` | `currentColor` | Same color API as ThinkingSprite. |

| Tamagotchi | Round pixel pet drifting, blinking, and walking |
| Cursor | Blinking I-beam text cursor |
| Arc | Spinning 3-pixel arc — modern loading spinner |
| Neural | 3-node network with a pulse traveling the edges |
| Think | Question mark draws in, holds, morphs into exclamation mark |
| Loader | Horizontal progress bar filling left to right |
| Radar | Boundary ring with rotating sweep arm from centre |
| Wave | Three dots bouncing with staggered sinusoidal phase |
| Cog | 4-tooth gear rotating between + and × positions |
| Ping | Center dot emitting expanding diamond rings |
| Clock | Ring face with fast minute hand and slow hour hand |
| Step | Three dots filling left-to-right then draining |
| Fill | 8-point ring filling clockwise, holds, resets |
| Grow | Three columns growing from bottom to different heights |

## LED matrix mode

When `color` is a tuple, all 64 grid cells render — dim for unlit, primary for lit. This gives a classic LED display effect.

```tsx
<ThinkingSprite
  variant="DNA"
  size={64}
  color={["#00ff88", "#0a1a0a"]}
/>
```

## TypeScript

`VariantName` is exported for autocomplete and type safety:

```tsx
import { ThinkingSprite, WriteSprite, type VariantName } from 'sprite-lite'

const myVariant: VariantName = 'DNA' // autocompletes all 55 names
```
